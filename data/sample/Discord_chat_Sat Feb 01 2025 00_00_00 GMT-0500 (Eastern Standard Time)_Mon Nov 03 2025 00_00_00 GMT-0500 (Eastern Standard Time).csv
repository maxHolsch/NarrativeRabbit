I am working with a group of cybersecurity professionals on AI security controls for a prominent organization. There is a section on applying access control to a vector database.  It concerns me that the security controls we recommended in the draft offer little to no value and could potentially create barriers for AI/ML practitioners. Although I have spent some time working with vector databases, my experience in building one is primarily through API integration with vendors.

HI ALL - **MCing** 
💫💫

Is a requirement for all to move up in hacker rank and generally gain club's trust. 

MCing is open to anyone who regularly attends sundais and ships hacks. 

Sundai is a community. We rely on volunteer effort from all to run the club TOGETHER. 

We will copy left this Burning Man principle -

*Participation*
*Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through [community] actions.*

Every python framework is a wrapper translating into javascript, so there will always be strictly less functionality available in python. If you’re growing beyond streamlit now, you’ll likely grow beyond the next python framework as well, and then you’ll have an even more complex code base to migrate to javascript.

Since <@343389545246490624> already did a PR to sundai.club and the task is urgent, he will do it this time. However there are a lot of other things we need to improve on our platform, in particular:

** Hacker profiles. **
*  The page is very raw and we need to make it look better
* Editing of the hacker profiles is broken right now
* We wanted to implement gamification and cool stats for each of the hackers (assign badges, EXP and levels for completed hacks).

** Social media sharing feature. **
* We need a ""share"" button next to the project card you created.
* When you press the button it should take the project description and prepare a draft for posting on a social media that you choose (LinkeIn / X).
*  <@925142354971721729> shared a URL structure that allows you to create a draft of a post for LI/X. We should use this feature
* We can also automatically tag the teammates (we have access to everyone's linked in in the platform) and past the image to the post from the preview


So if <@416218505751298068> <@523338374132531204> <@318754413487325194> <@343389545246490624> (or anyone else) would like to work on this features, pls let me know 🙂",godeva#0、bigbostonguy#0、the_technocrack#0、connorb3#0、debamitro#0,

For now In the test mode we will try to have one of the hackers do a ~45 minutes intro to a technology / domain at the beginning of each Sundai. (Maybe it’s an intro to tools/new tech on build Sundai’s and intro to domain/problems on grow Sundais?).

The goal is to keep learning newest tech together, share links to the dataset/models/tools around the topic. You can think of the intro to Maestro at the AI21Labs hack, intro to payments by Radius or the overview of open problems in space by <@841619442362482720> and <@709807664800202753>  in the space hack.

This upcoming week <@756604846890811473> will prepare an intro like that for autonomous agents (with a small part about MCPs). 

If you would like to make a similar talk on one of the upcoming Sundais — please reply here.

1.  
Thank you Manolis and the entire Mantis team for an incredible opportunity for Sundai to explore this awesome tech. 

And the thousands of hours of collective work you all put into building it. 

And most importantly - for inspiring our hackers to think further into data understanding, 

**and to stay in the state of the art of MIT research - which is one of our key goals at Sundai**

@ Jophy Ye, Chris Argyros, Alexios Ntavlouros, Anas Maarouf,  Arun Vinayagam, Pascal, Matt, Luca and Manolis Kellis.

Great chatting on Sunday about market research and all the challenges early-stage teams face with gathering feedback. A lot of what we talked about actually inspired us while building Pollystack.

We’re officially launching Pollystack on Product Hunt today. It’s a modern, fast alternative to Google Forms, designed to help early teams move faster and look more professional. You can build beautiful, customizable forms and surveys in less than 5 minutes and get clean dashboards that make your data easy to act on.

We’d really appreciate you checking out the new launch and your support with an upvote or comment on Product Hunt if you have a moment. It really helps us get the word out!

In most cases, paying for an existing dedicated scraper for tricky websites is the best solution, especially if you’re not planning to make web scraping your main business.

1. Real-time Road Safety Alerts (UK-based)
Barry is a highway worker-turned-founder from the UK who's on a mission to prevent traffic injuries and deaths by giving drivers better awareness of what lies ahead.

I’m putting together a small remote team (two full-time paid positions) for an R&D project focused on building a data visualization SaaS platform in collaboration with a cybersecurity company based in Washington, D.C. The project will run 3 to 5 months (likely from September 2025 through January 2026).

I’m open to what the team proposes as long as we deliver a functional production SaaS by the end of the project. Structured data will be provided.

These positions are open to U.S. citizens, residents, or individuals eligible to work in the U.S. Unfortunately, I’m unable to sponsor or verify work authorization at this time.

If you're interested, feel free to reach out. I’ll be following up after August 20.

## What is Sundai
A global network of AI hackers who come together weekly to build, ship, and deploy AI applications in a single day. Unlike other tech meetups that focus on presentations, Sundai Hacks are about co-creating in teams to turn ideas into shipped products within 12 hours. 

Sundai is born out of MIT and Harvard.



## Attendee Screening Criteria 

Each Attendee Must Be Able To ""Actively Build"": 
- **Code** - ability to code or a commitment to 
- **Team** - build in a team and bring positive value (and vibe) 
- **Ship** - focus on deploying a user-facing application by end of the day 

### Commitment Requirements:
- **Full day participation* - 10am-10pm or equivalent. Drop offs highly discouraged as it breaks team dynamic. 
- **Sundai projects only** - work on ideas born at sundai hacks, not personal projects from before
- **Community contribution** - help with setup/cleanup. We are all volunteers. Everyone helps to run the event. 
- **Attribution** - post projects on sundai.club/projects and clearly display 'Built at Sundai' on website or demos (e.g. footer, etc) 


- **Pre-Launch Checklist (7-8pm)**:
  - Open source code on GitHub
  - Create project page on sundai.club
  - Write blog/vlog documentation
  - Post on social media (minimum LinkedIn)
  
- **Launch (8-9pm)** - live user testing, not pitch presentations. Team shares with community about which new tools they tried and what worked / didnt work.

tool that turns 30s pitch videos into blog posts
project health checker (which projects are missing links, broken demos, etc.)

Sundai will post your card and promote your project for you on social media so that you can get some public exposure and notoriety for your 12 hours of hard work and your project will be featured at the top of the project list on the website. 

In order to have the most impact when Sundai posts your app, in addition to filling out the card in its ENTIRETY, you should have a 2 minute demo video discussing FEATURES and TOOL INSIGHTS, and a DEPLOYED LIVE LINK so users can quickly and effortlessly use it. All this can be placed in the card and your demo video can be used at the end of day leaving questions to cover the live portion.

Deploying and creating a good card takes time and will siphon off building minutes, so if you need help doing it, let me know and I can pitch in just ping me.

Much like Hacker Combinator is an effort to turn our projects into real world stuff, this small move will help projects gain traction in the real world so let's all work together and continue to push ourselves into the realm of practicality.

Thursdays 10am-12pm, at the MIT Media Lab, starting **next week on Sep 4** and running through December 

Space in limited, enroll for credit if you're MIT/Harvard student, join the waitlist if you're not but want to participate. This run of the course will be focused on CS/builders and will be more technical than previous ones. 

> This MIT course brings together technical teams to build AI-first products two years ahead of the market. This fall we will focus on agentic web intelligence, autonomous companies, AI-native coding, physical-world robotics, and AI personalization, challenging students to create ventures (or labs, foundations, societies, etc.) with significant impact on the world.

Please share this message with your friends who may be interested in this course 🙏",,

I’ve already talked to Stripe (no chance unless you're massive), Helcim (needs 100 clients), and Stax (wants $6k just to integrate 🙃). None of those work for our current stage.

Mike Grandinetti is co-teaching a new entrepreneurship course at Harvard Business School in the fall semester known as Ideation and Prototyping for Innovation. The course will help students walk through the business side of building a startup but we'll also be teaching students how to use vibe coding to develop their prototype for the second half of the course.
We're looking for people to serve as mentors to give students hands-on help with vibe coding across four workshops and would love to have some mentors from Sundai. This is the first time vibe coding is being taught at HBS, so they're expecting a lot of energy and social media buzz.

If you're interested, please reach out to Mike at mike.grand@gmail.com (even if you can't make both sessions).

Dates:
Monday, October 20 and Monday, October 27 from 3-6PM

Tracks:
Beginner – Solid, Bolt, Base44
Intermediate – Solid, Bolt, Base44
Advanced – Cursor

Note: Most of our students (85–90%) are not technical, so they will be in the Beginner or Intermediate tracks. The Advanced track will focus on Cursor and Claude Code.",,
